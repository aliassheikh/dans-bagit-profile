Scope \u00b6 This document specifies what constitutes an acceptable DANS bag. This includes all the requirements for a bag to be successfully processed by the ingest workflow. What is acceptable as a SIP is sometimes not exactly the same as what is acceptable as an AIP . Where these are different, this is documented. Overview and conventions \u00b6 Key words \u00b6 The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 . The key word \"SHOULD\" is also used to specify requirements that are impossible or impractical to check by the archival organization (i.e. DANS). The client should do its best to meet these requirements, but not rely on their being validated by the archival organization. Subdivisions \u00b6 The requirements are subdivided into the following sections: BagIt-related requirements - requirements that refer back to the BagIt specifications Structural requirements - requirements regarding the directories and files in the bag Metadata requirements - requirements regarding the metadata files included in the bag Bag sequence requirements - requirements regarding the metadata that records how a sequence of bags can represent the history of a dataset The sections are numbered and may have numbered subsections. The requirements themselves are stated as numbered rules. To uniquely identify a specific rule, use the notation <section-nr>[.<subsection-nr>].<rule-nr> , e.g., 2.3.4 for the fourth rule in subsection 3 of section 2. SIP vs AIP \u00b6 Rules that only apply to SIPs or AIPs are annotated with the comments \" (SIP) \" and \" (AIP) \" respectively. All other rules apply to SIP and AIP alike. Stand-alone vs in-sequence-context validation \u00b6 There are two levels of validation: stand-alone : this includes the validation steps that can be performed without taking into account any data outside the bag, in particular the bag store that the bag is (to be) stored in. This means that only the rules in sections 1-3 are checked in this level. in-sequence-context : this includes all the checks done in stand-alone validation plus checks that involve the bag-sequence that the bag is (to be) part of. This means all the rules in this document are checked. Stand-alone validation can be useful when you do not have access to the target bag store. Another reason to do only stand-alone validation may be that the overhead of doing calls to the bag store over the network is too high. XML namespaces \u00b6 When referring to XML element or attribute names or attribute values that have a prefix (such as dcterms:identifier ) an element in a certain namespace is intended. The table below lists the mapping from prefix to namespace. In the actual document, the namespace may be bound to a different prefix, or be the default namespace.

Glossary \u00b6 This section defines a number of terms that may be useful when discussing this specification. Several of these terms are used in the Requirements section of this document. Where terms are used in the definitions of other terms, they are printed in italics . AIP : Archival Information Package, as defined in the OAIS Reference Model . See also AIP . bag : a data package conforming to the BagIt specifications. bag-sequence : a sequence of DANS-bag*s, that together represent the history of an archived *dataset in the DANS Data Vault . bag-store : storage for immutable bag*s. All DANS *bag-stores combined are called the DANS Data Vault . (version N) DANS-bag : a bag that also conforms to (version N) of the DANS BagIt Profile specifications. base-revision : the revision that is used to reference a complete bag-sequence . Usually, this is the oldest revision . corresponding bag-files : files in different bag*s of the same *bag-sequence , that are identical or have the exact same path (including the file name) within the bag. DANS Data Vault : the *bag-store*s of DANS combined. dataset : the DANS implementation of the Information Package concept from the OAIS Reference Model . An archived dataset corresponds to an AIP . A dataset is represented in the DANS Data Vault as a bag-sequence . deposit : a dataset as it is delivered to DANS by the depositor , i.e. the SIP , as it is being transformed into an AIP . depositor : the agent sending data to DANS for archiving in the DANS Data Vault . This term corresponds to the Producer in the OAIS Reference Model . inactive bag : a bag that is present in the DANS Data Vault , but no longer disseminated. To the external user the bag appears to be deleted. A bag that is not inactive is active. revision : a DANS-bag that has been successfully archived in the DANS Data Vault . It has a UUID identifier and a timestamp that records its place in the bag-sequence . SIP : Submission Information Package, as defined in the OAIS Reference Model . See also SIP . update-deposit : a deposit that is intended to be added as a revision of an existing, archived dataset . version : a revision that has its own version-DOI . A version of an archived dataset may be updated by new revision*s that keep the same *version-DOI . version-DOI : a DOI that references a version of an archived dataset . If the version consists of several revisions , the version-DOI resolves to the most recent of those *revision*s. Requirements \u00b6 1 BagIt related \u00b6 1.1 Validity \u00b6 (SIP) The bag MUST be VALID according to the BagIt specifications. 1.2 bag-info.txt \u00b6 The bag MUST contain a bag-info.txt file.

The file metadata/dataset.xml MAY have one dcterms:license element as a child of the dcmiMetadata element. It MUST NOT have more than one such element. If present, and if it contains an attribute xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\" , then the element text MUST be one of the URIs of approved licenses . (AIP) The file metadata/dataset.xml MUST contain at least one dcterms:identifier element with an attribute xsi:type=\"id-type:URN\" . The text of this element MUST be a syntactically valid urn:NBN identifier which SHOULD be resolvable. Any dcx-dai:DAI elements MUST contain a syntactically valid Digital Author Identifier (DAI) with a valid check digit. This DAI SHOULD refer to an existing author. The DAI MAY be provided as a info:eu-repo/dai/nl/ URI. Any gml:postList elements nested in gml:Polygon elements: MUST have an even number of values. MUST have at least three different pairs of values, each of which describes one point. MUST start and end with the same pair of values. If a gml:MultiSurface is used, all nested gml:Polygon MUST have the same srsName attribute. Any gml:Point , gml:lowerCorner and gml:upperCorner elements MUST have at least two values. These values MUST be numeric. In case of RD ( http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992 ) the values should be within the valid range. Any dc:identifier or dcterms:identifier element with xsi:type=\"id-type:ARCHIS-ZAAK-IDENTIFICATIE MUST have a value of 10 or fewer characters. All URLs MUST be valid URLs with protocol http or https 3.2 metadata/files.xml \u00b6 If the file metadata/files.xml declares the DANS bag file metadata schema namespace then it MUST adhere to that schema. The document element MUST be files . The document element MUST contain zero or more file elements, and MUST NOT contain other elements. Each file element MUST have a filepath attribute which contains the bag local path to the payload file described. When an original-filepaths.txt exists, rule 2.7.2 applies. Directories and non-payload files MUST NOT be described by a file element. There MUST NOT be more than one file element corresponding to a payload file and every payload file MUST be described by a file element. Each file element MUST contain at least one dcterms:format element containing the Media Type of the file described. Each file element MAY contain any number of other DC or DCTERMS elements describing the file. It MUST NOT contain elements from other namespaces, unless permitted by the DANS bag file metadata schema schema. Each file element MAY contain either one dcterms:accessRights (DEPRECATED) or files:accessibleToRights and/or files:visibleToRights (RECOMMENDED). The values of these elements are limited to ANONYMOUS, RESTRICTED_REQUEST and NONE. It is recommended to make files visible to all, by setting files:visibleToRights to ANONYMOUS. 3.3 metadata/depositor-info/agreements.xml \u00b6 (AIP) The file metadata/depositor-info/agreements.xml MUST adhere to DANS deposit agreement metadata . 3.4 metadata/depositor-info/message-from-depositor.txt \u00b6 The file metadata/depositor-info/message-from-depositor.txt MUST be a plain text file using the UTF-8 character encoding. It SHOULD contain any remarks that the depositor wants to convey to the data manager who is to curate this deposit. 3.5 metadata/depositor-info/depositor-agreement \u00b6 (AIP) The file metadata/depositor-info/depositor-agreement.pdf or metadata/depositor-info/depositor-agreement.txt contains the agreement that exists between DANS and the depositor. 3.6 metadata/amd.xml \u00b6 (AIP) The file metadata/amd.xml is optional. If it is present it MUST adhere to DANS administrative metadata . 3.7 metadata/emd.xml \u00b6 (AIP) The file metadata/emd.xml is optional. If it is present it MUST adhere to DANS EASY metadata dataset . 4 Bag sequence requirements \u00b6 (AIP) The bag MUST be virtually-valid in the context of the bag store it is stored in. If bag-info.txt contains the element Is-Version-Of the UUID in its value MUST be the bag-id of an existing, archived bag. This bag SHOULD be the base revision for the dataset that is to be updated by the deposit. (AIP) The bags of a bag-sequence MUST be stored in the same bag-store. (AIP) The EASY-User-Account in bag-info.txt MUST be identical in all the bags of a bag-sequence. The accessibility and visibility of a dataset file MUST NOT be set to more restrictive than in previous, active revisions. Explanation: the previous revisions are the other bags in the same bag-sequence with a value in their bag-info.txt 's Created -element, that is earlier than the Created -value in the bag under validation. For each file specified in metadata/files.xml , the corresponding bag-files in the previous revisions MUST NOT have an effective accessibility or effective visibility that are more open than the accessibility of that file. The accessibility and visibility for a file are found in the file element with a filepath attribute matching the bag local path of the file, in the files:accessibleToRights and files:visibleToRights element texts, respectively. The possible values, with increasing restrictiveness are: ANONYMOUS , RESTRICTED_REQUEST , NONE . If the files:accessibleToRights and/or files:visibleToRights elements are not specified, the effective value can be derived from the ddm:accessRights element value in metadata/dataset.xml , using the following table: ddm:accessRights default files:accessibleToRights default files:visibleToRights OPEN_ACCESS ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS REQUEST_PERMISSION RESTRICTED_REQUEST ANONYMOUS NO_ACCESS NONE ANONYMOUS References \u00b6 AIP - Archival Information Package bag-store - storage for immutable, virtually-valid bags BagIt - packaging format on which the DANS Data Vault is based DANS administrative metadata - shema for administrative metadata DANS bag file metadata schema - schema for content file specific metadata DANS dataset metadata schema - schema for dataset level metadata DANS DCTERMS extension: Digital Author Identifier - extensions to accommodate Digital Author Identifiers DANS DCTERMS extension: Geography Markup Language - extensions to accommodate Geography Markup Language DANS deposit agreement metadata - schema for metadata about the agreement between DANS and the depositor DC - Dublin Core metadata elements DCTERMS - metadata schema from which elements are used in several DANS metadata schemas DOI - Digital Object Identifier EASY administrative metadata schema - legacy schema for administrative metadata EASY administrative workflow metadata schema - legacy helper schema for EASY administrative metadata schema EASY metadata schema - legacy schema for dataset level metadata GML 3.1.1 Simplified Features profile Levels 0 and 1 - Profile of Geography Mark-up Language ISO 8601 - standard for formatting dates and times Media Type - identifiers for file formats OAIS Reference Model - reference model for long term preservation archives RFC 2119 - specification for use of requirement level key words SIP - Submission Information Package URIs of approved licenses - licenses that may be used for datasets deposited in the DANS archive urn:uuid - URN scheme for UUID s urn:NBN - URN scheme for National Bibliographic Numbers UUID - universally unique identifiers XML Schema - constraint language for specifying types of XML documents","title":"Profile"},{"location":"versions/0.0.0/#dans-bagit-profile-v0","text":"","title":"DANS BagIt Profile v0"},{"location":"versions/0.0.0/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"versions/0.0.0/#version","text":"Document version: 0.0.0 Publication date: 2019-05-02","title":"Version"},{"location":"versions/0.0.0/#status","text":"Status of this document is PUBLISHED.","title":"Status"},{"location":"versions/0.0.0/#scope","text":"This document specifies what constitutes an acceptable DANS bag.

(AIP) The EASY-User-Account in bag-info.txt MUST be identical in all the bags of a bag-sequence.

Explanation: the previous revisions are the other bags in the same bag-sequence with a value in their bag-info.txt 's Created -element, that is earlier than the Created -value in the bag under validation. For each file specified in metadata/files.xml , the corresponding bag-files in the previous revisions MUST NOT have an effective accessibility or effective visibility that are more open than the accessibility of that file. The accessibility and visibility for a file are found in the file element with a filepath attribute matching the bag local path of the file, in the files:accessibleToRights and files:visibleToRights element texts, respectively. The possible values, with increasing restrictiveness are: ANONYMOUS , RESTRICTED_REQUEST , NONE . If the files:accessibleToRights and/or files:visibleToRights elements are not specified, the effective value can be derived from the ddm:accessRights element value in metadata/dataset.xml , using the following table: ddm:accessRights default files:accessibleToRights default files:visibleToRights OPEN_ACCESS ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS REQUEST_PERMISSION RESTRICTED_REQUEST ANONYMOUS NO_ACCESS NONE ANONYMOUS","title":"4 Bag sequence requirements"},{"location":"versions/0.0.0/#references","text":"AIP - Archival Information Package bag-store - storage for immutable, virtually-valid bags BagIt - packaging format on which the DANS Data Vault is based DANS administrative metadata - shema for administrative metadata DANS bag file metadata schema - schema for content file specific metadata DANS dataset metadata schema - schema for dataset level metadata DANS DCTERMS extension: Digital Author Identifier - extensions to accommodate Digital Author Identifiers DANS DCTERMS extension: Geography Markup Language - extensions to accommodate Geography Markup Language DANS deposit agreement metadata - schema for metadata about the agreement between DANS and the depositor DC - Dublin Core metadata elements DCTERMS - metadata schema from which elements are used in several DANS metadata schemas DOI - Digital Object Identifier EASY administrative metadata schema - legacy schema for administrative metadata EASY administrative workflow metadata schema - legacy helper schema for EASY administrative metadata schema EASY metadata schema - legacy schema for dataset level metadata GML 3.1.1 Simplified Features profile Levels 0 and 1 - Profile of Geography Mark-up Language ISO 8601 - standard for formatting dates and times Media Type - identifiers for file formats OAIS Reference Model - reference model for long term preservation archives RFC 2119 - specification for use of requirement level key words SIP - Submission Information Package URIs of approved licenses - licenses that may be used for datasets deposited in the DANS archive urn:uuid - URN scheme for UUID s urn:NBN - URN scheme for National Bibliographic Numbers UUID - universally unique identifiers XML Schema - constraint language for specifying types of XML documents","title":"References"}]}
